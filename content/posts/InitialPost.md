I start this blog website recently, willing to document my experiences during
work, and to practice my writting skills.

<!--more-->

I'm currently studying in Computer Architecture, and I write mainly about it.
More detailed, it's about Operating System, Hardware development (like Verilog
HDL, Chisel and etc.), and other involved subjects. Meanwhile, I'd like to write
some experiences about work flow, say, the advanced usage about `git`, better
ways to manage a project, scripting & automatics, and etc. There're a lot to write
about.

At present, I am persuing my bachelor degree at Huazhong University of Science
and Technology (aka. HUST), and I've received the offer for further graduate
study, from HUST, too. I expect to do a lot of writting during my future graduate
study. It's better that I prepare for it in advance.

In the end, no matter who you are and how you get to my website, I hope my articles
can do some help for your problems, or at least be useful. Hope you a nice day!

:D
